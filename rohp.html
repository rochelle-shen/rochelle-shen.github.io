            <p>Regents’ Overnight Host Program (ROHP) hosts about 80 perspective UC Berkeley freshmen each night for 6 nights. This opportunity is giving for those who received an interview for the Regents’ and Chancellor’s Scholarship,  the most prestigious scholarship offered by UC Berkeley to entering undergraduates, and attracts, retains, and graduates the most sought-after students in the world, a chance to experience Berkeley life.<br><br>During the duration of the program, these students get tours of the campus, stay a night in the dorms, try dining hall food, and learn all about the culture and academics at Cal. <br><br>The website is a crucial part of the registration and informational process for potential  participants of the program.</p>

            <p>Previously before taking on this project, there was already an existing ROHP website that was hosted on Weebly. It provided very minimal features, only offering basic FAQ and a short ‘About’ section, with no sight of a contact page.   My partner and I spoke with current ROHP committee members to obtain feedback from the current website and collected all aspects that should be changed. We even spoke with students who attended the program and chose Cal as their school of choice. We were also able to gather information from surveys about the flow.</p>

            <p>First was to see if we should just remake the Weebly website by adding more information, but we realized if we wanted more customization, we would need to completely scrap the entire website which is what we ended up doing. <br><br>We first drew out a wireframe of the home page, as well as the other pages on pencil and paper. This was then relayed to our team for feedback to see the differences between our potential design change versus the old website. <br><br>Changes were constantly made from various feedback and participants until we sketched a final draft of the website. This was then coded into the webpage.</p>

            <p>This was designed on paper and transformed to code with HTML and CSS, with Flexbox pop-up functionality.<br><br>With the renovation of a new website, we wanted to persuade members immediately with a large, full screen bird’s eye view photo of the Berkeley campus at night to capture attention. The colors of blue and gold also give the  campus spirit along with the phrase: “Welcome to the Golden Bear family.”<br><br>Various campus landmarks photos are displayed in the background. The flow of the website allows visitors to easily understand the registration process: how to register, Eventbrite registration, and FAQ. The Eventbrite ticket integration that easily allows users to register on the spot instead of needing to navigate to a new website manually.<br><br>A “filter by date” option was also included to allow participants to view the anticipated schedule, speakers, and performances for the selected date they were going to attend, which was not included on the previous website. </p>
