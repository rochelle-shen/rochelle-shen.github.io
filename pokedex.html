            <p>Over the past summer 2016, the launch of Pokémon Go became the fastest game to top both the App store and Google Play. With that said, its impressive growth led for fans (like me) to be able to play their loved childhood game on their mobile devices.<br><br>This mobile application is created for Pokémon enthusiasts, players, or those who just want to learn more about Pokémon. It contains a list and detail description of the Pokémon from Generation I so that users can fulfill their desire for Pokémon knowledge through the handy Pokédex.</p>

            <p>There are already many Pokédex applications created. I went through several popular ones to see the differences and realized that a lot of them were not really designed but simply had all the information spilled in the app while others had nice UI but poor UX and detailed information.<br><br>The goal was to combine these two good qualities: full of information and beautiful UI and UX into one. I asked various individuals with different Pokémon experience: avid strategic players, character fans, all for fun, or little exposure. All answers had one revolving similarity - they all wanted to be able to see a nice detailed description of a certain Pokémon and have a flawless search feature.</p>

            <p>This project was designed on Sketch and Photoshop.<br><br>Knowing how important the search feature was along with the good practice of eliminating extra information and content, the app immediately leads into the featured screen above.<br><br>Search is made simple. Users can easily choose 3 search options as shown. Search by name or #, picking random 20, or search by stat and type. This three fulfill the purpose of the app - letting the user find what Pokémon they want to know. Searching by stat and type was also found to be a plus for those avid strategic players who would need detailed information on Pokémon that fit their needs.<br><br>With a neat and easy two tab app interface, users are able to just search and view their selected favorite Pokémon. The screen shown below demonstrates an example of a “detailed” view once the user selected a Pokémon to view.<br><br>This contains all the information that users want to see: name, image, type, species. This page is ended with the feature allowing users to add this Pokémon as one of their favorites or search for another.</p>
