										<p>Below is a sample of my work from my summer internship at <a href="http://www.ongo.life">Ongo</a>, a platform geared towards personalizing healthy programs to help users achieve their health goals. This mobile and web based application aims to be intelligent to make it easier for users to become health conscious in their daily routines. Ongo suggests food plans, work out routines, meditation programs, and more that account for <em>your</em> body type and <em>your</em> needs versus providing a generic plan that may or may not work for all users.</p>
                                        <hr />
                                        my roles included: <b>iOS mobile development, iOS mobile UI design, UX research, usability testing</b><br />
                                        <hr />
                                        <h3>Problem</h3>
                                        <p>Ongo has programs in the mobile app called <i>Go</i> sessions, which are quick meditation or exercise routines that are less than 10 minutes long so that users can do them on the <i>Go</i>. However, it takes users more than 4 taps through unintuitive screens with no guidance to actually find these programs that are meant to be accessed on the go. This leaves users feeling frustrated if they are unable to find these <i>Go</i> sessions and leaving others confused that these programs even exist in the app.</p>
                                        <p><b>Therefore, having more taps required to a key feature makes it more difficult to retain users and keep them engaged.</b></p>
                                    
                                        <hr />

                                        <h3>Research</h3>
                                        <p>I began the redesign process by understanding what context users would use the <i>Go</i> session. I spoke with 10 users of the application as well as 10 more individuals near Cal's gym facility, using a set of questions I made standard across the interviews. This process allowed me to better understand when and where users would access a quick <i>Go</i> session workout or program.</p>
                                        <h5><u>Interview Findings</u></h5>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li><b>Trouble finding the Go sessions</b> was a common issue that the users all had in common. Infrequent users did not realize there were even Go sessions while more regular users still had a hard time remembering how they got to the Go session page</li>
                                            <li>Users mentioned <b>wanting to access Go sessions easily</b> without having to dig too far in the app</li>
                                            <li>Some felt that it would be <b>troublesome to search everytime</b> for their preferred Go session</li>
                                            <li>They <b>liked the concept</b> of a Go session and how it was quick compared to the longer daily sessions</li>
                                        </ul>
                                    
                                        <hr />
                                    
                                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                                        <p>I was able to gather great feedback from the interviews and <b>analyze the data to find some insightful information.</b> I wanted a design solution that would allow users to be able to access the sessions easily, be presented some intro to the idea of a Go session the first time, and be able to access the recently done Go sessions so the user does not need to search everytime. I drew inspiration from different "easy access" buttons that other iOS apps use as a method of having some type of quick action. I knew that having a one step process was needed for the purpose of this feature, so I could elimiation design methods that required multiple taps or having the Go session split among different pages.</p>
                                    
                                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center"><img src="images/ongo/postit.jpg" style = "width: 50%" alt=""/></div>

                                        <h3>Usability Testing</h3>
                                        <p>After narrowing down my design decisions to the three prototypes, I wanted to speak with users again to see which flow worked best for the end user and what didn't so that I was able to iterate on the process and then develop the final product. I asked users to walk me through the flow of how they would use a Go session. I then compared the flow to the original flow and asked them how they felt about the changes.</p>
                                        <p>I took into account their considerations and the users generally gave similar feedback on this testing process. Many of them said that the first prototype (1) blended in too much with the normal session on the home screen and felt that this provided more confusion. Users also felt that the (2) option presented them too many options at once and felt almost overwhelming.</p>
                                    
                                        <hr />
                                    
                                        <h3>Final Product</h3>
                                        <p>Therefore, after much deliberation, discussion, and tweaking, I went with the (3) prototype and added some extra items to seal the deal. I included an initial popup screen with a one liner on how <i>Go</i> sessions work that would only be shown the first time. I implemented a feature that would immediately display the last 3 used <i>Go</i> sessions so that the user can access the same ones faster or have the option to scroll past the 3 to select one from a category of their choice. The popup animation also added a fun touch to the element and gave a new style of <i>Go</i> sessions which aimed to be a more playful feature.</p>

                                        <h3>Final Thoughts & Challenges</h3>
                                        <ul>
                                            <li>I needed to constantly prioritize the app's theme of being playful, yet trusting.This was a something I needed to learn and gather through exposure before immediately delving into designing with my own style. </li>
                                            <li>I also kept in mind the development side of things since I would be developing this feature as well.Therefore, I kept a more open eye on what would be more feasible to develop in the alotted time but still constraining to the given feedback and design goals.</li>
                                            <li>I thoroughly enjoyed the iteration part of the design process. I loved being able to interpret the thought process of the end users and use this information to create a better fitting product for the user.</li>
                                            <li>Nevertheless, I was glad to see my implementation come to life in production and make it easier for users to use and enjoy the <i>Go</i> session feature.</li>
                                        </ul>
