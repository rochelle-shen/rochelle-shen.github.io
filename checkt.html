            <p>Checkt is an automatic check-in application with its goal of making checking in to meetings or events easy and simple, created for both members and leaders. For members, it provides an easy check-in process with zero user interaction by signing the user in through geo location services. This causes a hassle-free process with no need for URLs or codes. For leaders, they are able to ensure members are there and have no need to deal with links or spreadsheets.</p>

            <p>Taking charge of attendance right now can be stressful. Attendance is particularly useful for many college events where participation is tracked. Members are given links or codes to sign in, which can be easily passed on to other people without actually attending the event. Although we are aware there is the potential of mobile location spoofing, it is drastically more difficult than passing a link / code the traditional way. </p>

            <p>As college students, we have realized that checking in to events has become a difficult and annoying process. We wanted to make it effortless so that users wouldn’t even need to take out their mobile devices and would simply just receive a notification on their home screen once they have “checkt” into an event.</p>
