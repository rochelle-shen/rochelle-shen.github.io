                                        <p>CalSeat aims to <b>bridge the gap for students</b> having a lack of information regarding study space availability and resources, which causes unneeded stress and frustration for those trying to get work done. CalSeat now presents the idea of having a web based application with the physical installation of a counter. This will accurately keep count of how many people are entering or leaving the study space, and the web app is able to <b>live update the amount of current people</b> at the preferred study space. Users are able to check the online status of the area <b>without having to worry about spending wasted time</b> wandering various study spots. I worked on this in a group of 4.</p>

                                        <h3>Goals</h3>
                                        As a student, I find myself running into the problem <i>everyday</i> of trying to find study space on campus. Therefore, I found it easy to get immersed into the issue and begin digging into the research of trying to solve this common problem of: <b>"How do we provide sufficient information to students regarding study space availability?"</b>

                                                <p>We conducted <b>15+ interviews</b> and gathered survey data from <b>over 70+ respondees.</b> This is what we were able to assess:</p>
                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>There were <b>5 places on campus that over 90%+ of students were aware of.</b> (Doe Library, Main Stacks Library, Moffitt Library, MLK student union, and Free Speech Cafe)</li>
                                                    <li>MLK student union and Moffitt Library were the <b>top 2</b> places that students studied at.</li>

                                                <ul>
                                                    <li>MLK & Moffitt were both very crowded and packed, whereas Haas library had multiple empty tables and seats.</li>
                                                    <li>Haas' study environment was generally more quiet, compared to Moffitt and MLK not because there were more people.</li>
                                                    <li>MLK and Moffitt seemed to be busier <b>due to the location</b> because the buildings were <b>more centralized on campus</b>.</li>
                                                    <li>Haas library seemed to be located further away on the edge of campus.</li>

                                        <ul>
                                            <li>Students are unaware of the facilities that are offered at these study spaces including whiteboards, study group rooms, and computers.</li>
                                            <li>People enjoy working alongside with friends, even if they are not studying the same thing.</li>
                                            <li>Many study spaces do not always address the basic study needs: allowing food to be eaten, good temperature, availble bathrooms, and open outlets. Students feel that this greatly lowers their productivity.</li>
                                        </ul>

                                        <hr />
                                        
                                    
                                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                                        <p>My top pick was the idea of combining a physical counter and having a web app together. These two fit like the perfect combination, since the counter provides a live update tracker and the website can display all needed information including the count, amenities, hours, and more. The student is able to just <b>simply take 2 minutes to check online to see if their desired study space is available</b> without taking 30+ minutes to walk to the spot and take a few rounds around the library.</p>
                                    
                                        <h5><u>Low-fi Concept Sketch</u></h5>
                                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center"><img src="images/calseat/sketch.png" style = "width: 55%" alt=""/></div>
                                        <p>I kept the users' needs in mind and realized that the first step users wanted to do was just find their desired study space so having a huge search bar will help gravitate the user towards the search action. The users also have many specifications they preferred at each study location, so listing out the available resources would allow the user to see what works for them.</p>

                                        <h5><u>Med-fi Design</u></h5>
                                        <div style = "display: flex; justify-content: center; align-items: center" class = "row">
                                            <div class="6u 12u$(small)" >                                   <img src="images/calseat/med1.png" style = "width: 90%" alt=""/>
                                            </div>
                                            <div style class="6u 12u$(small)" >                                   <img src="images/calseat/med2.png" style = "width: 90%" alt=""/>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>I turned the drawings into digital prototypes without focusing on the color choice. I realized that having a graph based on the current date will allow users to easily toggle to see the fluctuation between dates. This will also represent which times are more crowded without much cognitive effort and also let them see how many people are currently at the location.</p>

                                        <h5><u>Hi-fi Design</u></h5>
                                        <div class = "row">
                                            <div class="6u 12u$(small)" >                                   <img src="images/calseat/hi1.png" style = "width: 90%" alt=""/>
                                            </div>
                                            <div class="6u 12u$(small)" >                                   <img src="images/calseat/hi2.png" style = "width: 90%" alt=""/>
                                            </div>
                                        </div>
                                        <p>I flushed out the final color choices and ended up going with blue and yellow tones to match Berkeley's school colors (Go Bears!), since this application was designed with Berkeley students in mind. I wanted to also have a main landing page that provided a straightforward way to understand what the purpose of CalSeat was. I added icons next to the 'Resources available' area to make it easier for users to spot without getting mixed up in the clutter of words. </p>

                                        <h3>Final Thoughts</h3>
                                        <p>This project really stemmed out of a current issue I faced, so it meant a lot to me to know that there are feasible solutions. By better understanding other students' viewpoint on this situation, I came to realize that <b>almost all people faced the lack of information about study space issue</b>. Taking look back at the process and design, I feel like I had a very thorough user experience research side, but this limited me on the amount of time I got to spend on the user interface portion. There are a handful amount of changes I would like to implement and could easily critique my own product design right now. Nevertheless, I want to make this idea a reality and speak with our school ASUC senators to see if this can happen!</p>
